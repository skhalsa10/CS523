"""
 This is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implementation to evolve the transition
 probabilities for 2d Cellular Automata (CA) which uses SIR dynamics for the
 spread of epidemics called Coronavirus (Covid-19). 
 This GA model tries to evolve 2nd variant of the disease spread and its transition probabilities.

 Implemented by: Anas Gauba

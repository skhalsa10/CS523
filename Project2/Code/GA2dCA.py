"""
 This is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implementation to evolve the transition
 probabilities for 2d Cellular Automata (CA) which uses SIR dynamics for the
 spread of epidemics called Coronavirus (Covid-19). 
 This GA model tries to evolve 2nd variant of the disease spread and its transition probabilities.

 Implemented by: Anas Gauba

"""
GA:
1) Randomly initialize populations p of CA.
2) Determine fitness of population
3) Untill convergence repeat:
      a) Select parents from population
      b) Crossover and generate new population
      c) Perform mutation on new population
      d) Calculate fitness for new population

1a. Assuming the covid-19 RNA is 30,000 nucleotides long, how many RNA strands of the same length
are exactly 1 mutation away?

n = 30,000
k = number of mutations
we have 4 types of nucleotides but since we are in a state already we can only change to 3 other ones.

The formula for how many possibilities are k mutations away is :
3^k* n choose k = 3^k*n!/k!(n-k)!

the total amount of possible mutations is the SUM of this from k = 0 to n

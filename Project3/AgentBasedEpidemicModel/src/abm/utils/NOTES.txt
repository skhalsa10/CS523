This file will be used for notes,assumptions made, and features to implement.

Features to implement in future
1. implement social distancing
    a. triggered by GUI after certain number of infected
    b. will cause peopleManager

ASSUMPTION
1. we assume there is a correlation between how sick someone is and how contagious they are
2. we assume that a building changes its contagionlevel based on how many people are inside that are infected
3. we assume in our sim that that a person can only get quarantined when they are located in their community
4. a person can not get infected while traveling to  building by another person. person can get infected after leaving a building.
5. When showcasing the graph I do not show quarantine. as far as the graph is concerned these are infected people.
6. A person while in quarantine doesn't spread the disease, we assume they are protected from the world and when quarantined, they stay in their
   community for some amount of time before they recover.
7. We are quarantine people who are above a symptomScale threadshold so we can see how it affects the curve.
8. We are assuming there are way more asymptomatic people.
9. We are going to assume a person gets infected but we let them roam around and keep spreading for like half a minute (countDown to quarantine) until we reach 0 seconds, then
   PeopleManager will initiate quaranting all the people who are above certain symptomScale threshold.

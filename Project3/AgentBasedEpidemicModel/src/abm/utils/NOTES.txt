This file will be used for notes,assumptions made, and features to implement.

Features to implement in future
1. implement social distancing

ASSUMPTION
1. we assume there is a correlation between how sick someone is and how contagious they are
2. we assume that a building changes its contagionlevel based on how many people are inside that are infected
3. we assume in our sim that that a person can only get quarantined when they are located in their community
4. a person can not get infected while traveling to  building by another person. person can get infected after leaving a building.
5. When showcasing the graph I do not show quarantine. as far as the graph is concerned these are infected people.
